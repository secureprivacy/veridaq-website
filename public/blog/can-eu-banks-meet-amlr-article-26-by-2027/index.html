The Anti-Money Laundering&nbsp;Regulation&nbsp;(EU) 2024/1624 (AMLR) Article 26 replaces static periodic reviews with continuous, risk-based monitoring. Financial institutions must now verify high-risk customers annually and low-risk customers at least every five years, with no exceptions. For a mid-sized bank with 50,000 clients, this means&nbsp;14,000 mandatory reviews annually—a volume that makes manual processes economically and operationally impossible.The penalties for failure are severe. Major AML breaches now trigger&nbsp;fines&nbsp;exceeding €200 million, and the new Anti-Money Laundering Authority (AMLA) will directly supervise the largest institutions starting in 2027. The solution lies in perpetual KYC (pKYC): automated&nbsp;systems&nbsp;that continuously monitor customer data and trigger reviews only when material changes occur. Financial institutions deploying pKYC platforms report 60–70% cost reductions while improving compliance accuracy. With less than 30 months to deploy compliant systems, waiting is no longer an option.What AMLR Article 26 Actually RequiresArticle 26 turns \"ongoing monitoring\" into a quantifiable, enforceable workload. The pain for a bank is that these are not soft expectations but hard, time bound obligations that instantly translate into case volumes and resourcing needs.For a mid sized institution with 50,000 customers, the Article 26 rules drive roughly 14,000 mandatory reviews per year, as high risk customers must be refreshed at least annually and low risk customers at least every five years under the&nbsp;AMLR. There is no flexibility by country: the same standard applies from Germany to Greece.The regulation forces banks to solve three problems at once:Hard review deadlines with no national wiggle roomThe&nbsp;official AMLR text&nbsp;sets maximum periods of 1 year for high risk and 5 years for low risk relationships. These caps apply to all obliged entities, regardless of size or business model. Any backlog means the bank is immediately outside the legal maximum for those customers.Relationship wide, continuous monitoring instead of product silosArticle 26 requires ongoing monitoring of the full business relationship, including transactions, to ensure behavior remains consistent with the risk profile. Opinions from bodies such as&nbsp;Accountancy Europe&nbsp;highlight that fragmented, product specific KYC systems are no longer acceptable: banks must aggregate accounts, loans, cards, payments and investments into a single customer view.Defensible evidence for supervisors and AMLASupervisors will expect banks to show when each customer was last reviewed, which triggers occurred since, and why the current risk rating is still appropriate. That requires time stamped activity logs, data lineage and consistent decision criteria across thousands of files, not scattered spreadsheets or isolated case notes.In short, Article 26 forces banks to industrialize KYC reviews at scale, within fixed time limits, across the entire relationship, and with proof on demand. Legacy, periodic approaches were not built for that level of precision and volume.Why Manual Processes Will FailWhen the Article 26 workload is translated into operational numbers, traditional manual processes quickly become untenable.A mid sized bank with 50,000 customers faces about 14,000 mandatory reviews every year. At a conservative 4 hours per file, that is 56,000 analyst hours, equivalent to roughly 28 full time specialists and well over €3 million in direct salary costs alone in many European markets. Analyses of KYC operations by firms such as&nbsp;McKinsey&nbsp;show that manual review capacity scales almost linearly with headcount, which makes this model economically fragile.Several structural weaknesses appear when volumes rise:Capacity and deadlines do not matchReview calendars, email reminders and spreadsheet trackers cannot reliably deliver thousands of files before the 1 year and 5 year limits. All it takes is a hiring freeze or a short term spike in alerts for backlogs to push customers past the regulatory maximum.Continuous monitoring is not truly continuousManual teams typically see a customer only at onboarding and then at the next scheduled review. If a client moves to a higher risk jurisdiction, changes beneficial ownership or becomes politically exposed shortly after a review, the change may go undetected for years. The&nbsp;FATF guidance on supervision&nbsp;stresses that this type of delay is inconsistent with a risk based approach.Quality drops under high volumeWith tens of thousands of hours to be processed annually, analysts face pressure to clear queues rather than challenge data.

Yet each of those "no change" outcomes still consumes several hours of skilled staff time. Budget is therefore locked into validating static low risk files instead of investigating genuinely high risk developments.</p></li></ol><p>These are design limits, not tuning problems. No amount of additional spreadsheets or manual checks will make a calendar driven process behave like a continuous, risk based monitoring system.</p><h2>How Automated Perpetual KYC Solves This</h2><p>Automated perpetual KYC (pKYC) is designed to address the exact pain points created by Article 26: fixed review intervals, relationship wide monitoring and the need for an auditable narrative on every customer.</p><p>Platforms such as&nbsp;<a href="https://veridaq.com/">Veridaq</a>&nbsp;continuously ingest internal and external data, detect material changes within days rather than years and automatically enforce the 1 year and 5 year limits.</p><p>The core shift is from calendar driven tasks to event driven workflows:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Article 26 pain point</th><th>Manual outcome</th><th>Automated pKYC outcome</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1 year / 5 year maximum review intervals</td><td>Risk of backlog and overdue files</td><td>System tracks elapsed time for every customer and triggers reviews before limits are reached</td></tr><tr><td>Relationship wide monitoring</td><td>Fragmented product silos</td><td>All products and key external sources feed a single, live risk profile</td></tr><tr><td>Proof on demand for supervisors</td><td>Difficult reconstruction from emails and files</td><td>Time stamped audit trail of data changes, decisions and escalations</td></tr></tbody></table><p>On top of this structural change, automated pKYC platforms typically deliver three operational benefits that directly relieve the Article 26 workload:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Continuous, data driven change detection</strong><br>Instead of waiting several years for the next periodic review, pKYC monitors sanctions lists, PEP databases, registries and key risk indicators daily. Material changes such as a new sanctions listing or a &gt;25 percent ownership shift can be identified within 24–48 hours, rather than emerging only at the next scheduled review.</p></li><li><p><strong>Risk based allocation of human effort</strong><br>High impact events (sanctions hits, major jurisdiction changes, significant adverse media) automatically route to experienced analysts with enhanced due diligence tools. Low impact events (minor address corrections, technical registry updates) can be closed with straight through processing. This typically reduces the number of full manual reviews by 40–60 percent while focusing human attention where supervisors expect it most.</p></li><li><p><strong>Built in compliance and audit trail</strong><br>The platform records when each file was last reviewed, which triggers were evaluated and why a specific rating or decision was chosen, creating an immutable history. This directly supports Article 26 examinations and reduces the time spent on audit preparation.</p></li></ul><p>The result is a KYC function that can absorb the 14,000-plus annual review obligation, meet the strict timing limits in the&nbsp;<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/1624/oj/eng">AMLR</a>&nbsp;and demonstrate a consistent, risk based approach, without unchecked growth in headcount or manual workload.</p><h2>Manual vs. Automated KYC: The Numbers</h2><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Dimension</strong></th><th><strong>Manual Periodic Reviews</strong></th><th><strong>Automated Perpetual KYC</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Trigger</td><td>Fixed calendar dates</td><td>Material changes detected via monitoring</td></tr><tr><td>Data Collection</td><td>Manual analyst gathering</td><td>Automated integration with 10+ European sources</td></tr><tr><td>Change Detection</td><td>Months to years</td><td>24–48 hours</td></tr><tr><td>Cost per Review</td><td>€50–80 (4–6 hours)</td><td>€15–25 (30 min–2 hours)</td></tr><tr><td>Review Consistency</td><td>Variable (60–70% error rate)</td><td>95% algorithmic consistency</td></tr><tr><td>Audit Trail</td><td>Prone to gaps, manual errors</td><td>Complete, automated, timestamped</td></tr><tr><td>Compliance Gaps</td><td>Information stale between reviews</td><td>Current data maintained continuously</td></tr><tr><td>Scalability</td><td>Linear cost increase</td><td>Flat cost curve beyond 100K customers</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Selecting the Right Platform</h2><p>Not all KYC systems are built for AMLR. Many legacy platforms retrofit continuous monitoring onto periodic review workflows, creating manual workarounds and incomplete audit trails. When evaluating vendors, prioritize:</p><p><strong>AMLR Compliance Features</strong></p><ul><li>Automatic enforcement of 1-year/5-year maximum review periods</li><li>Event-triggered workflows that route changes by materiality and risk</li><li>Comprehensive relationship coverage across all product lines</li><li>Native audit trail capturing every data source, decision, and timestamp</li></ul><p><strong>European Regulatory Fit</strong></p><ul><li>EU data residency (Frankfurt/Amsterdam) with no non-EU cloud dependencies</li><li>Pre-configured support for 6AMLD, MiCA, and PSD2 requirements</li><li><a href="https://accountancyeurope.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/241218_AML_Regulation_Factsheet_AccountancyEurope.pdf">GDPR</a>-by-design architecture (Articles 25, 32, 35)</li><li>Multi-language support for customer communications</li></ul><p><strong>Operational Efficiency</strong></p><ul><li>Straight-through processing for low-risk changes</li><li>Machine learning risk scoring (≥95% accuracy)</li><li>Automated document collection and verification</li><li>Implementation timeline of&nbsp;<strong>2–4 weeks</strong>&nbsp;(not 6–12 months)</li></ul><p>Veridaq's platform, for example, meets these criteria with EU-only data centers, native AMLR workflows, and a 4-week deployment model. European banks using it report&nbsp;<strong>70% faster reviews</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>95% risk classification accuracy</strong>, and zero ongoing monitoring fines post-implementation.</p><h2>Act Now or Risk Enforcement</h2><p>AMLR Article 26 creates a binary choice: automate or fail. Manual processes cannot satisfy mandatory review frequencies, continuous monitoring obligations, or AMLA's examination standards. The cost of inaction—<strong>€200M+ fines</strong>, failed audits, and competitive disadvantage—far exceeds the&nbsp;<strong>€150K–€500K</strong>&nbsp;investment in automated platforms.</p><p>Banks implementing pKYC achieve 60–70% cost reduction, 95% decision consistency, and complete audit readiness. With the 2027 deadline, the window for measured deployment is closing fast. Institutions that move first will not only achieve compliance but also free resources for growth and innovation.</p><p>Meta Title (under 60 char) Can EU Banks Meet AMLR Article 26 By 2027?</p><p>Meta Description (under 160 char) Yes. By replacing manual KYC with automated pKYC platforms like Veridaq, EU banks can meet Article 26 deadlines, cut costs and satisfy AMLA scrutiny.</p><p>Summary (under 100 words) AMLR Article 26 forces EU banks to move from periodic reviews to continuous, risk based KYC with strict 1 and 5 year deadlines. Manual processes cannot scale to handle 14,000 reviews a year for a 50,000 customer bank without high cost and compliance gaps. Automated perpetual KYC platforms like Veridaq continuously monitor risk data, trigger event driven reviews and maintain an auditable trail, helping banks meet deadlines, cut operational effort and satisfy AMLA expectations ahead of the 2027 enforcement date.</p>
