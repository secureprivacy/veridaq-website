  "articleBody": "EU Travel Rule Compliance 2025: What Banks and CASPs Must Do NowThe Bottom Line on EU Travel Rule ComplianceThe EU Travel Rule—officially the Transfer of Funds Regulation (TFR)—requires every bank, payment service provider, and crypto-asset service provider to collect and transmit originator and beneficiary information for all transactions, with no minimum threshold. The regulation became enforceable on December 30, 2024, with the technical infrastructure deadline of July 31, 2025 now passed. Unlike FATF's €1,000 threshold recommendation, the EU applies stricter rules: all transfers must include complete data, regardless of amount. As of November 26, 2025, all institutions must have fully operational technical systems in place. Institutions that fail to comply face direct supervision by AMLA, significant fines exceeding €200 million on average, and potential license revocation.&nbsp;EU TFR factsheetThe regulation goes further than FATF guidelines by requiring real-time data exchange, automated risk scoring, and transaction rejection protocols when information is missing or incomplete. Banks and CASPs must have secure technical infrastructure, monitoring systems, and GDPR-compliant data handling fully operational. As of November 26, 2025, the July 31, 2025 technical infrastructure deadline has passed, meaning all institutions must now be in full compliance with no exceptions. For most European financial institutions, this represents a fundamental shift from threshold-based compliance to universal transaction transparency.&nbsp;EBA GuidelinesWhat Is the EU Transfer of Funds Regulation (TFR)?The Transfer of Funds Regulation (EU) 2023/1113 is the EU's implementation of FATF Recommendation 16, commonly known as the \"Travel Rule.\" It mandates that payment service providers (PSPs) and crypto-asset service providers (CASPs) collect and transmit complete originator and beneficiary information for every fund transfer and crypto-asset transfer within, into, or out of the EU. This includes names, addresses, account numbers, and distributed ledger addresses where applicable.Zero-Threshold RequirementThe most significant departure from FATF guidelines is the zero-threshold requirement. While FATF recommends applying the Travel Rule to transactions exceeding €1,000, the EU TFR applies to all transfers regardless of amount. However, enhanced due diligence and verification obligations only trigger at €1,000. This means institutions must:Collect originator/beneficiary data for every transaction (no exceptions)Verify accuracy of data for transactions exceeding €1,000mplement automated systems capable of processing 100% of transactionsTFR official regulationSelf-Hosted Wallet ProvisionsThe TFR also addresses crypto transactions from self-hosted wallets (private wallets not managed by CASPs). When transactions exceeding €1,000 originate from self-hosted wallets and interact with hosted wallets managed by CASPs, beneficiary CASPs must collect originator information. This provision closes a significant compliance gap exploited for money laundering.&nbsp;Notabene TFR guideWho Must Comply: Banks, Fintechs, and Crypto ExchangesObliged EntitiesThe TFR applies to:Payment Service Providers (PSPs):&nbsp;Banks, e-money institutions, payment institutions offering fund transfersCrypto-Asset Service Providers (CASPs):&nbsp;Exchanges, wallet providers, custodians, and any entity offering crypto transfer servicesIntermediary Providers:&nbsp;Any intermediary facilitating fund or crypto-asset transfers between PSPs or CASPsAll entities—whether EU-based or serving EU customers—must comply if they process transfers involving EU residents or entities.EEA ExtensionThe TFR applies across the European Economic Area (EEA), covering all 27 EU member states plus Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway.

Institutions must ensure they are in full compliance:</p><ol><li><strong>Conduct Immediate Compliance Audit:</strong>&nbsp;Verify current systems meet TFR Article 16 requirements without exceptions</li><li><strong>Identify and Remediate Gaps:</strong>&nbsp;Address any remaining manual processes or incomplete systems immediately</li><li><strong>Validate Technical Infrastructure:</strong>&nbsp;Ensure real-time data collection and transmission systems are fully operational</li><li><strong>Verify Staff Readiness:</strong>&nbsp;Confirm compliance, operations, and IT teams understand current TFR obligations</li><li><strong>Test System Performance:</strong>&nbsp;Validate data accuracy, transmission security, and rejection protocols under production conditions</li><li><strong>Document Full Compliance:</strong>&nbsp;Maintain comprehensive audit trails demonstrating TFR compliance for AMLA review</li></ol><p>Any institution not yet in full compliance faces immediate risk of direct AMLA enforcement action, fines exceeding €200 million, and significant competitive disadvantage as compliant peers maintain market trust. The EU Travel Rule is no longer optional—it's the foundation of European financial transparency. With AMLA direct supervision beginning in July 2027 (19 months away), institutions must demonstrate complete compliance now. Purpose-built platforms like Veridaq can rapidly remediate compliance gaps, ensuring your institution meets current TFR requirements without operational disruption.</p>
