The threshold is now 25% or more, and a\nparallel control test brings in individuals with decisive influence,\nsuch as veto powers or the right to appoint directors. If no one qualifies,\nfirms must record the senior managing official and document the steps\ntaken. Strengthened central registers give obliged entities better tools\nfor cross-checking data and resolving discrepancies. For compliance teams, the\nchange means adapting onboarding and monitoring to capture stricter thresholds,\nindirect holdings, and control rights, making beneficial ownership across the\nEU more transparent and harder to conceal.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhat is UBO?\n\nA UBO (Ultimate\nBeneficial Owner) is a real person who ultimately owns or controls a\ncompany or legal entity. The UBO is the person who benefits from ownership or\ncontrol, even if their name does not appear directly in public records or legal\ndocuments. Here are the Key points:\n\nOwnership: A UBO is typically someone who holds a large\npercentage of shares, voting rights, or other ownership interests. In Europe\nunder the new AML rules, that threshold is generally 25% or more (KPMG).\n\nControl: A person may still qualify as a UBO without a\nlarge shareholding if they can exert influence in other ways, such as through\nveto rights, the power to appoint or remove directors, or other mechanisms of\ndominant influence (KPMG).\n\nTransparency: The objective is to reveal who is truly behind\ncompanies or trusts, so that criminals cannot hide through complex structures\nor shell entities (Sanctions.io).\n\n\n\nWhy this matters now?\n\nThe EU’s AML package ends fragmentation. It\ncomprises AMLR (Regulation (EU) 2024/1624), AMLD6 (Directive (EU) 2024/1640),\nand the AMLA Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2024/1620). All were published in the\nOfficial Journal on 19 June 2024. This single rulebook forces consistent UBO\nidentification and registers checks across the bloc, with direct application\nfrom 10 July 2027 for AMLR.\n\n\n\nWhat is a UBO under AMLR/AMLD6?\n\nFor higher-risk\ncategories of legal entities, the Commission may adopt a delegated act under\nAMLR to set a lower beneficial ownership threshold — down to 15% — in place of\nthe standard 25%, when justified by the risk profile of the sector. (AMLR,\nRegulation (EU) 2024/1624) \n\nIf, after applying\nboth the ownership test (25% or more ownership, direct or indirect) and the\ncontrol-via-other-means test (such as veto rights, appointment/removal of\ndirectors, or other forms of dominant influence), no natural person qualifies\nas a UBO, obliged entities must identify the senior managing official(s)\ninstead. They are not regarded as the beneficial owner per se, but their\nidentity must be verified and recorded. The entity must also keep a full record\nof what due diligence was performed, what was checked, and why no UBO could be\nfound. (AMLR, Regulation (EU) 2024/1624)\n\n\n\nVerification steps for obliged entities under AMLR\n\nObliged entities must\ntake structured steps to identify and verify ultimate beneficial owners. The\nAMLR and AMLD6 set out a clearer process:\n\nIdentify and verify UBOs using reliable and independent sources\nsuch as company registers, shareholder documents, or agreements.\n\nCross-check client information against national or EU\ncentral registers, which now contain stronger and more complete data.\n\nResolve\ndiscrepancies where\ninformation from clients and registers does not match, and keep a record of the\noutcome.\n\nMaintain a detailed\naudit trail showing which\ndocuments were reviewed and how decisions were made.\n\nFallback to senior\nmanaging official only when no\nUBO can be identified. In this case, record both the official’s details and the\ndifficulties encountered during the search.\n\nThis step-by-step\napproach ensures transparency, creates evidence supervisors can rely on, and\nreduces the risk of hidden ownership going undetected.\n\n\n\nWorked Example: How Ownership and Control Both Create UBOs\n\nImagine a medium-sized\ntrading company with two key investors. Person C directly owns 20% of the\ncompany’s shares. The majority stake, 60%, is held by a parent company called HoldCo3.\nWithin that parent, Person D owns 45%. When you follow the ownership chain, D’s\nindirect interest in the trading company is 45% of HoldCo3’s 60%, which equals 27%.\nUnder the AMLR rules, this makes D a UBO by ownership, since the threshold is\n25% or more.\n\nAt the same time, the\nfounders’ agreement gives Person C a special budget veto right. Even though C’s\nshareholding is below 25%, this contractual power amounts to control, so C also\nqualifies as a UBO by control.\n\nIn practice, both\nindividuals must be recorded as beneficial owners. The company should keep the\nevidence on file, such as the shareholder registers and the relevant sections\nof the founders’ agreement. Because at least one UBO has been identified through\nownership and another thro",

<h2><span lang="EN-US">Worked Example: How Ownership and Control Both Create UBOs</span></h2>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">Imagine a medium-sized
trading company with two key investors. Person C directly owns 20% of the
company’s shares. The majority stake, 60%, is held by a parent company called HoldCo3.
Within that parent, Person D owns 45%. When you follow the ownership chain, D’s
indirect interest in the trading company is 45% of HoldCo3’s 60%, which equals <b>27%</b>.
Under the AMLR rules, this makes D a UBO by ownership, since the threshold is
25% or more.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">At the same time, the
founders’ agreement gives Person C a special budget veto right. Even though C’s
shareholding is below 25%, this contractual power amounts to control, so C also
qualifies as a UBO by control.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">In practice, both
individuals must be recorded as beneficial owners. The company should keep the
evidence on file, such as the shareholder registers and the relevant sections
of the founders’ agreement. Because at least one UBO has been identified through
ownership and another through control, there is no need to fall back on listing
the senior managing official.<br style="mso-special-character:line-break">

<h2><span lang="EN-US">The Role of KYC and AML Platforms</span><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"></span></h2>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Modern KYC and AML platforms give
compliance teams the tools to handle the stricter UBO rules set out in AMLR and
AMLD6. Automated ownership-chain mapping helps trace indirect holdings through
multiple layers, while built-in logic applies the 25% or more test and flags
potential UBOs by control rights. Direct connections to national and EU
beneficial ownership registers make it easier to cross-check declarations,
resolve discrepancies, and keep evidence audit-ready. Platforms also generate
tamper-proof logs and structured workflows, ensuring that every
decision—whether identifying a UBO or recording a senior managing official
fallback—is fully documented. By centralizing data, applying consistent rules,
and reducing manual errors, these systems turn complex compliance requirements
into repeatable, transparent processes that regulators can trust.<br style="mso-special-character:line-break">

apply to voting rights and profit interests?</span></strong><span lang="EN-US"></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Yes. Under AMLR, ownership is measured not
only by shareholding but also by voting rights and other forms of ownership
interest.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Yes. For high-risk sectors, the European

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">No. They are recorded only as a fallback
when no natural person can be identified through ownership or control. AMLR
requires firms to document why the fallback was necessary and to maintain a
clear audit trail.</span></p>
