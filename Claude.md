# Claude Project Overview

This repository is structured so that the `project/` directory acts as the working root when importing into Bolt.new.

- Install dependencies with `npm install`.
- Run the development server with `npm run dev`.
- Lint the project with `npm run lint`.

Additional architecture details are documented in `BOLT_AND_AI_ARCHITECTURE.md` in the same directory.
