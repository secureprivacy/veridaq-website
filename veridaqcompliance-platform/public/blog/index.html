If no one meets these criteria, firms must record the senior managing official and document the steps taken. The strengthened central registers provide better tools for cross-checking data and resolving discrepancies. Compliance teams need to adapt their onboarding and monitoring processes to capture stricter thresholds, indirect holdings, and control rights, making beneficial ownership across the EU more transparent and harder to conceal",

With AMLA now operational across the EU since July 2025, financial institutions face direct supervision and standardized enforcement of the four core CDD steps: customer identification, information verification, risk assessment, and ongoing monitoring. Modern automated platforms reduce CDD costs by 60 to 70 percent while accelerating customer onboarding by 70 percent—essential capabilities for meeting AMLA technical standards and avoiding regulatory fines exceeding 8.2 billion EUR imposed on European banks between 2020 and 2024. Veridaq&#039;s purpose-built EU compliance platform delivers 95 percent accuracy in customer verification and risk assessment with complete audit trails, EU data residency, and support for 6AMLD, AMLA, MiCA, and PSD2 requirements across all 27 member states.</p>

        <p class="excerpt">The new Anti-Money Laundering Regulation (AMLR) and Sixth Directive (AMLD6) in Europe, which refine the definition of an Ultimate Beneficial Owner (UBO). The threshold for UBO identification is now set at 25% or more ownership, and a parallel control test includes individuals with significant influence, such as veto powers or the right to appoint directors. If no one meets these criteria, firms must record the senior managing official and document the steps taken. The strengthened central registers provide better tools for cross-checking data and resolving discrepancies. Compliance teams need to adapt their onboarding and monitoring processes to capture stricter thresholds, indirect holdings, and control rights, making beneficial ownership across the EU more transparent and harder to conceal</p>
